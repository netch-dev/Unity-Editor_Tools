	 * Brainstorm:
     * ===============
     * 1. Change the colour of a folder
     * -  Right click on a folder and see a list of colours
     * -- Using MenuItems, an editor class that allows you to display menus
     * 1.1 Paint a rect with the background texture on top of the original folder
     * 1.2 Draw a custom / coloured icon
     * 
     * 2. Change the icon of a folder
     * - Right click on the folder and see "Custom Icon..." option
     * 
     * 3. Reset the icon of a folder
     * -- Using MenuItems
     * --- Make sure the user is only able to select folders
     * ---- Use Unity.ObjectPicker 
     * 
     * 4. Save Data
     * - Using two techniques: EditorPrefs and custom json file
     * -- Save data using GUIDs (Global Unique Identifiers)
     * --- Every folder and icon has a GUID
     * ---- Data structure: Dictionary<string, string> where the key is the GUID of the folder and the value is the GUID of the icon
     *
     * ===============
     * Notes:
     * ===============
     * 1. Name the editor script folder "Editor", so that the scripts aren't built into the final game
